# William Zamites's Portfolio

My personal site meant to feature my work in music and software development.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project to run on localhost:3000. This is the development version of the project.

### Prerequisites

Check that you have node and npm installed

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If not, get it here https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

### Installing

cd into the directory you'd like the project to live, then

```
git clone https://github.com/wzamites/react-portfolio
cd react-portfolio
```

This installs the dependencies as defined in package.json, then starts the development server

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Deployment

This isn't deployed yet but we'll see.
