# Github to Portfolio

This setup is meant to be able to take ANY github username, display the repositories, and be able to filter by language or technology used.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project to run on localhost:3000. This is the development version of the project.

### Prerequisites

Check that you have node and npm installed

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If not, get it here https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

### Installing

First cd where you'd like the project to live, then clone the repository there

```
git clone https://github.com/wzamites/react-portfolio
cd react-portfolio
```

Then, install the dependencies as defined in package.json, and start the development server

```
npm install
npm start
```
By default, this will open localhost:3000 in a browser and will update immediately as you save changes

##Customizing
In order to load your GitHub projects as cards, edit the following file

```
src/assets/socials.js
```

There you will see the following

```
//enter usernames only

const socials = {
  domain: "",
  linkedin: "",
  github: "",
}

export default socials

```

In order to load the first 30 GitHub projects as cards, change the ```github``` parameter to your username
